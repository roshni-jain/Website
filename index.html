             <h3> Welcome to Bundle.</h3>
             <h4> The Place where great things come together to form better ideas.</h4>

                 Bundling of subscriptions is a Internet of Things concept. It is a profit-maximizing tool for customers as well as the industry. Customers can integrate and <b>customize</b> their bundle. This service provides an opportunity for growth by intriducing <b>new products</b> while minimizing the churn rate of a previous product. 
             </p>
             <p>
                 Subscription service business models are based on the idea of selling a product or service to receive monthly or yearly recurring subscription revenue. In essence subscription business models focus on the way revenue is made so that a single customer pays <b>multiple payments</b> for prolonged access to a good or service. Most people select different subscriptions from different vendors such as <strong>clothing, electronics, televisions, and makeup</strong> and end up paying more than usual in convenience fees and taxes. Customized bundling over the alternatives of pure bundling or individual sale under different assumptions about the customer preferences is a huge point that most companies are missing these days.

            The idea for this company came from a <b>Bag.</b> Our founder <b>Roshni Jain</b> she was trying to find a backpack which could fit all her needs but was alos cost efficient. One day she was out shopping. While shopping she felt really tired that she had to carry so much stuff in her hands. If only there was a way to <b>bundle her stuff</b>. She quickly took out her phone and wrote down the idea for bringing together stuff from various industries. And thus <b> Bundle </b> was founded.
